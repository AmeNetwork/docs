A communication channel that facilitates interaction between players in on-chain games.

This proposal introduces a multiplayer game communication (MGC) interface, using `room` to match and group players, and using `message` to process actions between players. This allows one smart contract to handle multiple players playing games on the chain, preventing centralized servers from affecting the fairness of the game

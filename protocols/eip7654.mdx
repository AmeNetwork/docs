Use a set of request methods to indicate the type of action to take on the contract.

This proposal standardizes a set of request and response communication standards between clients and smart contracts, using POST, GET, and PUT requests to create, read, and update the states of smart contracts. You can customize different request method names, request parameters and response values, and each request method will be mapped to a specific operation.

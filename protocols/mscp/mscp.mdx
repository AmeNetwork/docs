---

A standard protocol that enables LLM applications to interact with EVM-compatible networks.

## **Features**

**Component as a service**\
AI Agent interacts with the network by operating different components.

**Fast integration**\
Component-based design makes it easier to build workflows and accelerates the development of AI applications.

**Unified interaction**\
Use consistent rules and protocols to standardize the calls to contracts with different functions and ensure the consistency of AI interactions.

**Dynamic expansion**\
AI Agent can add custom onchain components with greater flexibility.

**EVM compatibility**\
It can interact with multiple EVM-compatible network contracts at the same time, and has greater adaptability in handling tasks in complex scenarios.

**Decentralization**\
Access component capabilities without permission, share onchain data, and provide persistent services and information verification.

## **Architecture**

### **MSCP consists of three parts:**

**Component:** This is an on-chain component that complies with [EIP-7654](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7654). It is used to implement the specific functions of the contract and provide custom services.

**Connector:** This is a method and specification for parsing Components and processing contract component requests.

**Chat2Web3:** This is an interoperator, which is used to automatically convert the interaction methods of contract components into tool functions that LLM can call. â€‹
